       Adjusting Margins for Multicolumn and Unicolumn Output

This package provides an extension of the multicol package with the
option to change the margins for multicolumn and unicolumn layout.
The package understands the difference between the even and odd
margins for two side printing.


Changes:

   v1.1  Changed calculations for unicolumn layout
         which might previously lead to loss of text

   v1.2  Bug fix: now adjmulticols works inside a box too.
